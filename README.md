Traffic Violation Analysis
This project presents an in-depth analysis of over 1.1 million traffic stops in Maryland, using public data provided by the Montgomery County Government. The goal was to uncover hidden patterns and key risk factors contributing to traffic violations and to generate insights that could support road safety improvements.

üîç Objective
Identify the most frequent causes of traffic stops

Analyze violation trends by time, season, location, and driver demographics

Explore relationships between violations and factors such as alcohol use, vehicle age, and license origin

üìä Key Findings
Top Violation: Failure to obey traffic control devices was more common than speeding

Time & Season: Most violations occurred during nighttime and in the summer

Demographics: Male drivers and owners of newer cars were more likely to be stopped

Alcohol Impact: No significant correlation was found between alcohol use and fatality, injury, or property damage

Location Patterns: Certain areas had notably high concentrations of traffic stops and fatal incidents

üß∞ Tools Used
Python and R for data analysis

Matplotlib, Seaborn, and geospatial plotting tools for visualization

Comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory analysis steps
